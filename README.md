## dbpRisk 2.0

dbpRisk 2.0 is a QGIS plugin designed to simulate and assess the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water distribution networks. It performs simulation experiments using EPANET-MSX files to model chemical reactions under various conditions and uncertainties. The plugin enables users to evaluate how different parameters influence DBP formation, offering insight into water quality dynamics. By integrating these simulations into the QGIS environment, dbpRisk 2.0 allows for spatially-informed risk analysis, helping decision-makers and researchers visualize, predict, and manage DBP-related risks more effectively.
